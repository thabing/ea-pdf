## Fonts

This directory should contain the fonts used in the EaPDF library.  Because of size, these fonts are not 
included in the source code repo, instead you should acquire them from the [Kurinto Font Folio](https://www.kurinto.com/index.htm).

Refer to the README.md files in the subdirectories under the Kurinto directory for a specific list of expected files in each subdirectory.

You can also customize the font selection by editing the various configuration files as described in the EaPdfCmd project's README.MD file.
